1. Write a function called greet that takes a name as an argument and returns a greeting message (e.g., "Hello, John!").

2. Write a function called checkEvenOdd that takes a number as an argument and returns "Even" if the number is even and "Odd" if the number is odd.

3. Write a function called dayOfWeek that takes a number (1-7) as an argument and returns the corresponding day of the week (1 = Sunday, 2 = Monday, etc.) using a switch case.

4. Write a function called sumNumbers that takes an integer n as an argument and returns the sum of all integers from 1 to n using a for loop.

5. Write a function called countDown that takes a number as an argument and logs all numbers from that number down to 1 using a while loop.

6. Write a function called gradeCalculator that takes a score (0-100) as an argument and returns the corresponding grade (A, B, C, D, F) using if blocks.

7. Write a function called fruitColor that takes a fruit name (like "apple", "banana", or "grape") as an argument and returns the color of the fruit using a switch case.

8. Write a function called doubleArray that takes an array of numbers as an argument and returns a new array with each number doubled using a for loop.

9. Write a function called guessNumberGame that simulates a simple number guessing game. The function should keep asking the user to guess a number until they guess correctly. For this exercise, you can assume the correct number is 7.

10. Write a function called fizzBuzz that takes an integer n as an argument and prints the numbers from 1 to n. For multiples of three, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for the multiples of five, print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five, print "FizzBuzz". Use regular functions, if blocks, and loops to implement this.
